# Project Context

This is your CLAUDE.md file for storing project-specific instructions and context.

## Getting Started
- Add coding standards and conventions here
- Reference other files using @filename notation
- Include build/test commands I should know about

## Examples
```
# To reference files:
See @README for project overview
See @package.json for available npm scripts

# To add instructions:
Always run tests before committing
Use TypeScript strict mode
Follow existing naming patterns
```
